Hello all! This is one of my projects from my JavaScript course on Udemy.com

I will be making a digital balance book. The course won't go far as to cache the files, but I'm going to attempt it anyway. 

This is good for anyone that needs a finance situation looked at. I had a bad history with finance, but I saw through and got out of it. It used to be a balance sheet like this but only in paper.
